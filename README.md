---

## **NOTE**

Starter data was included in this assignment, which was provided by the course.

## **Description**

This project focuses on building a relational database to analyze employee data using PostgreSQL. The database stores and organizes data about employees, their departments, job titles, salaries, and managerial roles.

---

## **Summary**

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Database Creation**:

   - Create a relational database schema with six tables: `titles`, `employees`, `departments`, `dept_manager`, `dept_emp`, and `salaries`.
   - Establish relationships between tables using primary and foreign keys.
   - Import data into the database from CSV files.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Write and execute SQL queries to answer specific questions, such as:
     - Employees hired in 1986.
     - Department managers and their details.
     - Employees in the Sales and Development departments.
     - Frequency of last names in the database.
